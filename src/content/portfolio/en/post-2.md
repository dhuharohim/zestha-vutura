        "OEA Journal is a specialized online platform dedicated to managing the submission, review, and publication of economic journals. This platform is designed to streamline the workflow for authors, reviewers, and administrators, ensuring efficient handling of academic and professional economic content.",
        "",
        "Project Workflow:
        Submission: Authors submit their economic journals through a user-friendly online submission form. The platform captures all essential details and supports various formats, making the submission process straightforward and efficient.

        Review Process: Submitted journals are directed to the admin panel, where assigned reviewers assess the content. The platform provides comprehensive tools for evaluating submissions, including criteria for economic relevance, methodology, and overall quality.

        Feedback Handling:

        No Comments: If a submission meets the review standards with no additional comments, it is automatically queued for publication, ensuring prompt dissemination of valuable economic research.
        Comments Provided: If reviewers provide feedback or comments, the submission is flagged for revision. Authors are notified and required to address the feedback and make necessary revisions before resubmitting.
        Publication: After revisions are made (if applicable), or if no comments were provided, the submission is finalized and published. The journal is then accessible to the wider community, facilitating the spread of economic insights and research findings."
