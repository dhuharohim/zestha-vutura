        "Kamuhukum Journal is a comprehensive online platform designed to facilitate the submission, review, and publication of legal e-journals. The website provides a structured workflow to manage academic and professional legal content efficiently.",
        "",
        "Project Workflow:

        Submission: Authors submit their legal journals through an intuitive online submission form. The system captures all necessary details and ensures that submissions are complete and accurate.
        Review Process: Once a submission is received, it is routed to the admin panel where designated reviewers evaluate the content. Reviewers have access to tools for assessing the quality and relevance of the submission.
        Feedback Handling:
        No Comments: If the reviewer finds the submission satisfactory with no additional comments, the system automatically proceeds to publish the journal, making it available to the intended audience.
        Comments Provided: If the reviewer provides feedback or comments, the submission is flagged for further action. The author is notified and must address the comments and make any necessary revisions before resubmission.
        Publication: After addressing reviewer comments, or if no comments were given, the submission is finalized and published. The journal becomes accessible to users, ensuring timely and efficient distribution of legal content."
